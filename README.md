MDM Image Viewer is a managed screensaver App for tvOS and an alternative to Conference Room Display only mode. 

**With MDM Image Viewer you can:**
* Run the App in single App mode and automate your processes for a zero-touch deployment.
* Give content curators access to managing the background image playlist.
* Allow your Apple TV to double as digital signage and an AirPlay device.

It is currently tested and working with Jamf Pro but should also work with other MDM providers.

* Airplay View Position: Set the starting X/Y coordinates of the Airplay box on the screen.
* Airplay Description Text - Change the text shown under the Airplay logo.

### CSV Image Playlist Settings Example
The CSV file liked in the managed preferences should show values including a header and in the order listed below. The "UpdateInterval" and "Cache" values are not currently used but should still be included within the CSV file.

| Name | URL | Duration | UpdateInterval | StartOn | EndBy | Cache |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Test Image | https://example.com/image.png | 0:00:10 | 1:00:00 | 1/1/18 0:00 | 12/31/99 23:59 | yes |

**Name** - Name of the image. This value is strictly for reference. <br />
**URL** - Web location of the image file. <br />
**Duration** - Length of time to display the particular image in **H:MM:SS** format. <br />
**UpdateInterval** - *Currently Unused* <br />
**StartOn** - Date and time to begin showing the specified image in the playlist in **M/d/yy H:mm** format. <br />
**EndBy** - Date and time to stop showing the specified image in the playlist in **M/d/yy H:mm** format. <br />
**Cache** - *Currently Unused* <br />

## Suggested Configuration
It is reccomended that you lock your Apple TV into single app mode with MDM Image Viewer. Images should not be larger than 3840px Ã— 2160px. Loading unessisarily large images may cause the App to crash.
