MDM Image Viewer is a managed screensaver App for tvOS and an alternative to Conference Room Display only mode. 

With MDM Image Viewer you can:
* Run the App in single App mode and automate your processes for a zero-touch deployment.
* Give content curators access to managing the background image playlist.
* Allow your Apple TV to double as digital signage and an AirPlay device.

It is currently tested and working with Jamf Pro but should also work with other MDM providers.

### Installation

A build of MDM Image Viewer is available for download from the [tvOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1439027089&mt=8). The current version should be deployed with App Configuration Preferences from Jamf Pro.



### Managed App Configuration Preferences <br />
App configuration Preferences are currently required to load the CSV file location through the "edu.nebraska.ImageViewer.dataURL" preferences key. All available keys are shown here: <br />

**edu.nebraska.ImageViewer.dataURL** (required) <br />
URL of the CSV file containing image information. There is no default option for this key and the App will not function as built without this value loaded. <br />
**edu.nebraska.ImageViewer.imageTimer** (optional) <br />
Time (in seconds) of the image timer default. Image display time length is specified in the CSV file but will default to this option if nothing is entered in the file. <br />
**edu.nebraska.ImageViewer.airplayViewHide** (optional) <br />
Boolean value set to false be default, override with a "true" value to hide the floating AirPlay box. <br />
**edu.nebraska.ImageViewer.airplayViewTimer** (optional) <br />
Time (in seconds) between movements of the AirPlay box. The default time is set to 33 seconds. <br />
**edu.nebraska.ImageViewer.dataCheckTimer** (optional) <br />
Time (in seconds) between checks for updates in the CSV file. The default time is set to 180 seconds. <br />
**edu.nebraska.ImageViewer.defaultBackground** (optional) <br />
This value can be set to "DefaultBackgroundNoLogo" in order to remove the MDM Image Viewer logo from the default background image. <br />**edu.nebraska.ImageViewer.defaultDescription** (optional) <br />Replace the AirPlay description with a custom one. <br />**edu.nebraska.ImageViewer.defaultSubtitle** (optional) <br />Replace the AirPlay subtitle "CHOOSE THIS APPLE TV" with a custom one. <br />


*Sample configuration preferences:*
```xml
<dict>
	<key>edu.nebraska.ImageViewer.dataURL</key>
	<string>https://link.to.preferences.csv</string>
	<key>edu.nebraska.ImageViewer.imageTimer</key>
	<integer>10</integer>
	<key>edu.nebraska.ImageViewer.airplayViewTimer</key>
	<integer>25</integer>
	<key>edu.nebraska.ImageViewer.dataCheckTimer</key>
	<integer>600</integer>
        <key>edu.nebraska.ImageViewer.defaultSubtitle</key>
	<string>SELECT THIS APPLE TV</string>
	<key>edu.nebraska.ImageViewer.defaultDescription</key>
	<string>New AirPlay description</string>
</dict>
```

### CSV Image Playlist Settings Example
The CSV file liked in the managed preferences should show values including a header and in the order listed below. The "UpdateInterval" and "Cache" values are not currently used but should still be included within the CSV file.

| Name | URL | Duration | UpdateInterval | StartOn | EndBy | Cache |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Test Image | https://example.com/image.png | 0:00:10 | 1:00:00 | 1/1/18 0:00 | 12/31/99 23:59 | yes |

**Name** - Name of the image. This value is strictly for reference. <br />
**URL** - Web location of the image file. <br />
**Duration** - Length of time to display the particular image in **H:MM:SS** format. <br />
**UpdateInterval** - *Currently Unused* <br />
**StartOn** - Date and time to begin showing the specified image in the playlist in **M/d/yy H:mm** format. <br />
**EndBy** - Date and time to stop showing the specified image in the playlist in **M/d/yy H:mm** format. <br />
**Cache** - *Currently Unused* <br />

## Suggested Configuration
It is reccomended that you lock your Apple TV into single app mode with MDM Image Viewer. Images should not be larger than 3840px Ã— 2160px. Loading unessisarily large images may cause the App to crash.
