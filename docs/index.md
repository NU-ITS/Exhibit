Exhibit, previously known as "MDM Image Viewer", is a managed screensaver App for tvOS and a great alternative for conference rooms and public spaces where managed Apple TVs are locked to Conference Room Display mode. With Exhibit, you can customize the Apple TVs in your collaborative spaces by displaying curated images and videos to your users. The App also displays an AirPlay box similar to Conference Room Display mode so users can easily identify the device.

<h3>Features:</h3>

* Run the App in single App mode and automate your processes for a zero-touch deployment.
* Give content curators access to managing the background content playlist.
* Allow your Apple TV to double as digital signage and an AirPlay device.

<h3>Requirements:</h3>

* Apple TV with tvOS 12 or higher
* A Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution such as Jamf.
* App Deployment through an MDM with required Managed App Config.
